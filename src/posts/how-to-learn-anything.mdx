Decide what you want to learn.

You can’t know exactly, because of course you don’t know exactly how any field is structured until you know about it. You
have to start learning the language, what to search for.. keywords, etc..

Read everything you can on it, especially what you enjoy, since that way you can read more of it and faster. Grab for insights.
Regardless of points others are trying to make, when you recognize an insight that has meaning for you, make it your own.
It may have to do with the shape of molecules, or the personality of a specific emperor, or the quirks of a Great Man in
the Field. Its importance is not how central it is, but how clear and interesting and memorable to you.

Remember it. Then go for another.

Tie insights together. Soon you will have your own string of insights in a field, like the string of lights around a Christmas
tree.

Keep improving your questions. In your head there are questions, that don’t seem to line up with what you are hearing. Don’t
assume that you don’t understand; keep adjusting the questions until you can get an answer that relates to what you wanted.

Your field is bounded where you want it to be. Just because others group things in conventional ways does not mean they are
necessarily right. Intellectual subjects are connected every which–way; your field is what you think it is.

Lastly.. always be learning. I see many adults slowing down on filling their knowledge-base with “new” concepts, skills,
or materials. This is when life begins to become boring and begin to feel trapped.
