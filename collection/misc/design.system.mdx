In 2023, I became super interested in design systems, component architecture, and component libraries.
To get a real grasp on it, I decided to build my own design kit from zero. It's been quite the journey,
one that requires patience and a genuine appreciation for the idea of _slow design_. By no means am I
"finished" with this project, nor would I say that a design system is ever truly complete.

Below is more on why I chose to build this project and the different design decisions I made while developing.
Also tons of things I learned and mistakes that I made.

#### Why

The realization hit when I saw inconsistencies in design across various web projects, including my own.
I found myself on a perpetual hunt for the "right" library that resonated with my design sense, yet nothing ever seemed
to fit seamlessly.

By constructing my own, I aimed to ensure a consistent look and feel, whether for a simple button or a multifaceted interface,
across all mediums. Plus, the prospect of creating a system specifically tailored to my tastes and project requirements was too appealing to ignore. I needed a toolkit that was spot-on, but also versatile and flexible enough for diverse scenarios.

#### The Start

My journey began with extensive research. I delved into popular design systems like Google's Material Design, Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines, and Airbnb's Design Language System to understand their structure and philosophy. These systems acted as guiding lights.

To lay the foundation, I started with the atomic design principles — breaking down interfaces into their basic components and gradually building them up. Design tokens became my best friend; defining colors, typography rules, and spacing constants to maintain consistency.

#### Problems and Setbacks

One of the initial challenges was the overwhelming ideas of components that could be created. It was tempting to design and code every possible UI element, but I soon realized the importance of prioritization and what that meant for consistency.

Another setback was design drift. As I evolved some parts of the system, earlier components sometimes became inconsistent with the newer ones. Keeping every piece in sync and cohesive was a demanding task. Feedback loops were also longer than anticipated, especially when validating usability and accessibility of each component.

#### Process

After setting a strong foundation with theming and deciding on a prioritized list of components, I transitioned into the development phase. Using tools like Storybook, I started building out my React components, ensuring they were modular and flexible.

For each component, the cycle was consistent:

1. design in Figma
2. transfer to code
3. test for functionality
4. validate for accessibility
5. and then iterate

I also established a documentation practice early on. For each component, there was a detailed breakdown of its purpose, usage guidelines, and code snippets. This not only acted as a reference for me but would also ensure that any other developer or designer could understand and use the system effortlessly.

#### Takeaways

Building a design system from scratch is a labor of love.
It requires patience, dedication, focus, and a genuine passion for learning.
Here are some lessons I learned along the way.

**Start Small, Think Big.** Instead of being overwhelmed by the entirety of the task, focus on building basic components first.
They form the building blocks for larger, more complex components. Try to perfect and understand one component before moving to another,
and when you do begin on the next– keep in mind the style of the previous.

**Documentation is Key.** A design system without thorough documentation is like a library without a catalog. It’s essential to document as you go.

**Iterate Continuously.** Design systems are living entities. They need to evolve based on feedback, new design trends,
or changing project requirements.

**Embrace Slow Design.** A design system is not a one-off project but a continuous journey. Enjoy the process, and remember that good things take time. Scale on your own time.
