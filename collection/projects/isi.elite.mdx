**Scope** → Build the landing page for a national marketing campaign title "Spring Training".
Also, build a custom banner to inject onto each location page (50+ pages), allowing configurations to toggle the price displayed on the banner.

#### Establishing an Overall Theme:

The initial step in any design project is to establish a cohesive theme that aligns with the brand's
identity and campaign objectives. For ISI® Elite Training's "Spring Training" campaign, my goal was to create a fresh
and energetic look by incorporating vibrant colors and dynamic imagery that evoked the spirit of spring and fitness.

#### Mocking Up Screens and Building Assets:

After defining the theme, I turned to Figma, a powerful design tool, to create detailed screen mock-ups.
Figma allowed me to visualize the layout, typography, and overall aesthetics of the landing page and banner.
Collaborating with the ISI® Elite Training team, we refined the designs until we achieved the desired look and feel.

#### Deciding on Framework, Codebase, and Styling Library:

To bring the designs to life, I carefully evaluated various options and selected a framework, codebase, and styling library that best suited the project's requirements.
These chosen technologies ensured scalability, performance, and maintainability, providing a solid foundation for the implementation.

#### Building a development env w/ CodeSandbox:

Prior to the final implementation, I developed a custom boilerplate on CodeSandbox, a browser-based development environment.
This step allowed me to test interactions, ensure layout responsiveness, and deliver a seamless user experience across different
devices and screen sizes. It also facilitated efficient collaboration and progress sharing with the ISI® Elite Training team.

### Final Implementation and Deployment:

After fine-tuning and testing the design, interactions, and layout, it was time to bring everything together. I wrote the final HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to implement the landing page, incorporating PHP scripts to dynamically display the content. This integration enabled the ISI® Elite Training team to effortlessly manage and update the content and prices for each location page.

**Conclusion**:

Working on ISI® Elite Training's "Spring Training" campaign was an exhilarating experience. Each step, from establishing the design theme to developing custom solutions, played a crucial role in creating a captivating landing page and custom banners for their nationwide marketing efforts. I take pride in the end result and am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to ISI® Elite Training's success.
