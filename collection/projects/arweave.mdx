### The process of creating a blog with Mirror.xyz, Arweave and Next.js.

<Space />

All of Mirror’s posts are available to access on Arweave, an on-chain decentralized storage layer
that makes it so that your posts exist forever (even if Mirror does not)!

Here’s a basic tutorial on how to get data published on Mirror directly from Arweave:

<Space />

- Grab the Mirror content digest from the end of a Mirror post URL. The URL for this post is
  `dev.mirror.xyz/Gj...mhw` and so the digest is `Gjss...3hw`.
- We’re going to plug this digest value into a query against Arweave’s graphQL endpoint to render
  the data
- We’re going to make use of a couple of tags to get the Arweave transaction via GraphQL. Every post
  on Mirror has a few tags we can use to filter for the content:
- `App-Name`: `MirrorXYZ` tells Arweave to scope the results to all posts on Mirror
  Original-Content-Digest: Gjs..rei3hw tells Arweave to return every single transaction that matches
  the requested content digest
- By default, we upload every single published update on a post to Arweave, so the query returns a
  list. To get the most recently published update sent to Arweave, we just sort the results by block
  height and grab the newest transaction.
- Once, we have the Transaction ID we need, we can use the getData function in the Arweave JS SDK to
  render the JSON content
- We can also verify that we have the correct transaction ID navigating to
  `arweave.net/<TRANSACTION_ID>` which will render the JSON
- Our digest Gj..hw returns a transaction ID of dysIrCovgAHJ6siGA5_r27Q59j2tv5wD4kqc1bxRFVE, which
  renders the content you see here.

```html
<div class="input-group">
  <div class="input-group-prepend">
    <label for="name">Name</label>
  </div>
  <input type="text" name="name" id="name" />
</div>
```

The GraphQL query is available as a gist here.

In order to bypass requiring content digests to populate Mirror posts, you can use the Contributor
tag to query for all posts made by a specific wallet. A full list of available tags is available on
the Transaction GraphQL object.
