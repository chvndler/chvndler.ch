Design systems have become an integral part of modern software development, providing consistency,
efficiency, and scalability. Design systems have always captivated my interest– not just in the
context of design, but across industries and disciplines. The concept of well defined rules,
guidelines, and an ecosystem of resources brings about a sense of vision and clarity to an idea.

These systems provide structure and alignment to an idea or process, systems help us stay organized
and focused on what's important, whether we're talking about design, productivity systems, or
personal roadmaps. Ultimately, all systems share the idea of helping us work with momentum– moving
us forward, in the same direction.

### Getting started with the kit.

First, install the package from npm:

```bash
npm install @atlrdsgn/kit
```

Then, import the components you need:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@atlrdsgn/kit';
```

Finally, use the components in your application:

```tsx
<Button>Click me</Button>
```

### Consistency and Efficiency

A design system ensures consistency across an application. By using the same set of components
throughout the application, users will have a familiar experience no matter where they are. This
consistency also makes it easier for developers to build and maintain the application. With a set of
pre-defined components, color scale, and icon library developers can quickly assemble new pages and
features without having to reinvent the wheel each time.

### Scalability

React's component-based architecture makes it easy to scale a design system as an application grows.
As new features are added, existing components can be reused and new components can be added to the
system. This modular approach to development makes it easier to maintain and update the application
over time.

### Collaboration

A React UI library and interface components also promote collaboration between designers and
developers. Designers can create components in tools like Figma or Sketch, and developers can easily
translate those designs into code. By working together to create a shared library of components,
designers and developers can ensure that the final product meets both aesthetic and technical
requirements.

### Accessibility

Finally, a system with can help ensure that an application is accessible to all users. By
implementing accessibility features like keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility into
the design system, these features can be easily applied across the entire application. This ensures
that all users, regardless of ability, can use the application with ease and free of issues.
