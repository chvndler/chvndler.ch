Design systems have become an integral part of modern software development, providing consistency,
efficiency, and scalability. Design systems have always captivated my interest– not just in the
context of design, but across industries and disciplines. The concept of well defined rules,
guidelines, and an ecosystem of resources brings about a sense of vision and clarity to an idea.

These systems provide structure and alignment to an idea or process, systems help us stay organized
and focused on what's important, whether we're talking about design, productivity systems, or
personal roadmaps. Ultimately, all systems share the idea of helping us work with momentum– moving
us forward, in the same direction.
